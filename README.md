# ABSTRACT
Despite the existence of many vulnerability detection methods, source code vulnerabilities continue to provide
prevalent attack vectors for cyber-attacks. Pre-existing methods of vulnerability detection often include manual
detection. However, these methods often require extensive labour time and produce results of a low accuracy. To
mitigate these issues, deep learning techniques have been developed to automatically detect vulnerabilities present in
source code. This paper proposes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model to create a solution that addresses
the issues surrounding manual vulnerability detection. The VulDeePecker dataset, composed of labelled code gadgets
of vulnerable and non-vulnerable C/C++ source code, is utilised to train and test the modelâ€™s performance. Four
evaluations are performed to assess the model on its ability to accurately generate predictions of whether source code
contains any vulnerabilities. The evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of applying deep learning
methodologies to vulnerability detection, yielding high accuracy results and low prediction times on the proposed
model. This suggests that a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model can reliably identify the occurrence or
absence of a vulnerability in C/C++ source code. Therefore, this paper presents an alternative solution to manual
vulnerability detection that mitigates its surrounding problems, such as being time-consuming and prone to errors.
